Problem Statment -> create a small File Transfer Server over
TCP/IP Protocol.

Currently File is being shared on localhost (127.0.0.1), for
sharing over a network replace "127.0.0.1" in both code by server
IP Address.

Compile:
./build

RUN:( execute each command in a new terminal )
./server
./client 9500 <src_file> <dest_file>

NOTE:
Use this code in CN Lab exam and cheat or share your codes and Beware ! Don't get
caught.
